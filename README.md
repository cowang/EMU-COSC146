- Datasets for student projects
  - George Cowan (This is an example of the kind of information that would be appropriate. You can ask for this dataset 
    if you like, but you must also include at least one additional dataset.)
    - Example WHO cumulative Corona Virus cases by date 
      - <https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset>
      - Download the datasets by clicking on the Download button under the header image. I have only looked at one of the files: 
        covid_19_data.csv. It's column descriptions can be found be expanding the Description section that is a little below 
        the download button. The file seems to be updated almost daily.
      - I think this would be an excellent dataset to explore because it is such an important topic, even though 
        it is not related to my major. Categorical fields would be Country/Region, and perhaps Province/State. 
        There are several numerical fields. Graphing the growth of cases over time for a selected state like 
        Michigan would be possible, but the date field looks different than what we have studied. I may need some help there.

    - Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Cards Dataset
      -https://www.kaggle.com/tathor/yugioh-trading-cards-dataset/data
      - YuGiOh is a card game that I have a lot of interest in and I think it would be fun to explore the most common card type or              monster attributes given the over 6,000 cards included in this data set.

    - I want to analyze NHL data from the birth of the NHL original 6 hockey teams.
    - I really enjoyed pokemon growing up, so I would use the data we previously used in an assignment. I want to see if there is a type bias, among other statitical analysis.
    - Weather data. It is cyclical and a different kind of data than the other two.
